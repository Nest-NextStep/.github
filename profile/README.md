Irene Guntur, an Educational Psychologist from Integrity Development Flexibility (IDF), has revealed that 87 percent of university students in Indonesia feel like they have chosen the wrong major for various reasons. This trend is concerning, and we aim to tackle this challenge faced by high school students as they prepare for higher education. Oftentimes, students find this decision overwhelming due to the abundance of available options, yet they lack personalized guidance. Therefore, our team is developing an innovative application that leverages AI to provide tailored recommendations based on students' RIASEC assessment test. In addition to this, the application will offer comprehensive educational catalogs, track important dates, manage tasks with customizable to-do lists, and enhance productivity with an integrated Pomodoro timer that will support higher education and career preparation. Providing personalized guidance and centralized information catalogs is crucial, especially given the high percentage of university students who regret their major choice. We aim to focus on the effectiveness and potential of AI-driven tools to personalize educational guidance and improve students' decision-making confidence. This will foster a future where students can unlock their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society.
